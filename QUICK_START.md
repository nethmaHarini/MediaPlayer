# 🎵 REAL AI SEPARATION - QUICK START

## ⚡ What I've Implemented

✅ **Real AI-powered music separation** using Facebook's HTDEMUCS model
✅ **Cloud-based processing** via Replicate API
✅ **Professional-grade separation** into vocals, drums, bass, and instruments
✅ **Individual track controls** with real separated audio
✅ **Progress tracking** for 1-3 minute processing time
✅ **Error handling** with fallback options
✅ **Cost estimation** (~$0.10-0.50 per song)

## 🚀 TO GET STARTED (5 minutes):

### 1. Get Replicate API Key

## 💰 Cost

## 🔧 Files Changed

- `services/RealAISeparationService.ts` - Real AI implementation
- `app/(tabs)/separation.tsx` - Updated to use real service
- `.env` - Your API key goes here
- `app.json` - Environment config

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Internet required** - Processing happens in the cloud
2. **Takes time** - Real AI separation needs 1-3 minutes
3. **Costs money** - But very affordable (~$0.25/song)
4. **High quality** - Professional-grade separation
5. **Works with any audio** - MP3, WAV, etc.

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

**"AI Service Not Configured"**
→ Add your API token to .env and restart

**"Processing Failed"**
→ Check internet connection or try shorter audio file

**"Upload Failed"**
→ Audio file might be too large (try <50MB)

**That's it! You now have REAL AI separation! 🎉**

The demo mode is completely replaced with professional-grade AI that actually separates your music into distinct tracks.
