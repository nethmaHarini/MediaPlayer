## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator
- Physical device for testing

### Installation

1. **Clone and Install**

```bash
cd MediaPlayer
npm install
```

2. **Install Additional Dependencies**

```bash
npx expo install expo-document-picker expo-file-system
```

3. **Start Development Server**

```bash
npx expo start
```

4. **Run on Device**

### AI Backend Setup (Optional)

To enable real AI processing, set up your backend API:

1. **Update Service Endpoints**

```typescript
// In services/SeparationService.ts
private apiEndpoint = 'https://your-ai-backend.com/api';

// In services/ChordAnalyzer.ts
private apiEndpoint = 'https://your-chord-ai-backend.com/api';
```

2. **Backend Requirements**

- Audio processing API (Spleeter, Demucs, etc.)
- Chord analysis API
- File upload/download endpoints
