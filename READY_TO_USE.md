# ✅ REAL AI SEPARATION - READY TO USE!

## 🎉 Your Replicate Token is Now Configured

Your API token `r8_WXrpUfRWLeejDjAmaBSYENFk6GvPWEQ2NsgJb` has been added directly to the code.

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

1. **Start the app**: `npx expo start --clear`
2. **Load audio**: Go to Player tab, select an audio file
3. **Separate tracks**: Go to Separation tab, click "Start Real AI Separation"
4. **Wait 1-3 minutes**: Real AI processing takes time
